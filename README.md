# 📘 Cats vs Dogs Classification – Final Project

This project builds an image classification model that can distinguish between **cats** and **dogs** using **transfer learning**. The model is trained in PyTorch with the EfficientNet architecture and evaluated on accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and sample predictions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

* Uses **EfficientNet (timm library)** for transfer learning
* Includes **data preprocessing and augmentation**
* Trains on the Cats vs Dogs dataset
* Evaluates performance with validation accuracy, loss curves, and misclassified samples
* Includes **Grad-CAM visualizations** to show which parts of the image the model focuses on
* Final notebook contains complete training → evaluation workflow
